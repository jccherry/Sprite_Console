2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP alu/out0 input alu/out0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP alu/out0 input alu/out0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP alu/out0 output alu/out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP alu/out0 multiplier stage alu/out0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net console_ppu/hvcount/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin console_ppu/hvcount/snes_data_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell console_ppu/hvcount/snes_data_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrl/clkdiv/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrl/clkdiv/counter[4]_i_2/O, cell ctrl/clkdiv/counter[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrl/clkdiv/counter_reg[7]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrl/clkdiv/snes_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell ctrl/clkdiv/snes_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT console_ppu/hvcount/snes_data_reg[11]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 12 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
snes_data_reg_reg[0], snes_data_reg_reg[10], snes_data_reg_reg[11], snes_data_reg_reg[1], snes_data_reg_reg[2], snes_data_reg_reg[3], snes_data_reg_reg[4], snes_data_reg_reg[5], snes_data_reg_reg[6], snes_data_reg_reg[7], snes_data_reg_reg[8], snes_data_reg_reg[9]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ctrl/clkdiv/counter[4]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 7 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ctrl/counter_reg[0], ctrl/counter_reg[1], ctrl/counter_reg[2], ctrl/counter_reg[3], ctrl/counter_reg[4], ctrl/enable_snes_clk_output_reg, ctrl/snes_latch_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ctrl/clkdiv/snes_clk_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 12 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ctrl/snes_data_reg[0], ctrl/snes_data_reg[10], ctrl/snes_data_reg[11], ctrl/snes_data_reg[1], ctrl/snes_data_reg[2], ctrl/snes_data_reg[3], ctrl/snes_data_reg[4], ctrl/snes_data_reg[5], ctrl/snes_data_reg[6], ctrl/snes_data_reg[7], ctrl/snes_data_reg[8], ctrl/snes_data_reg[9]
